I came into college not knowing exactly what I wanted to do with my life; all I wanted to do was enjoy life in southern Louisiana and go to football games. And while I have in fact enjoyed southern Louisiana life and have been well-immersed with the student section at games, I have also had my path completely set for me to follow and thrive on through LSU.
