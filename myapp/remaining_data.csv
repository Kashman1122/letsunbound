One of the things I appreciate most is the emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and real-world application. As someone planning to major in economics I was drawn to how NYU blends academic theory with practical experiences. I’m excited about the opportunity to learn from renowned faculty and collaborate with peers from all over the world.

Although I haven’t started classes yet, the admissions process and communication with the university have already shown me that NYU cares about its students. The support has been clear, and the resources for new students—from orientation to academic advising—are impressive.

In my opinion, Auburn is nothing short of amazing! I love the campus-wide involvement and how much everyone truly does love Auburn. If I had to change one thing about Auburn, it would be the lack of diversity. I understand Auburn is based in Alabama, but the majority of the campus is white in a middle to high socioeconomic status. This keeps students enrolled at Auburn from accessing diverse experiences and hearing diverse opinions in class discussion, or even passing by on campus. Diversity is an integral part of society.

Last week, my friend with a nut allergy broke out in hives after eating a salad (and that's not an isolated incident). There are no vegan/vegetarian/healthy options since Bucknell changed dining providers, and while they made changes over winter break, they made no adjustments to accomodate students who fall into any of these categories. Instead, they added more fried chicken, burgers, and crepes to the menus. You can't even get a hot vegetable in the Bison or Commons dining areas (where upperclassman eat). I've communicated with them through their feedback texts, in a committee meeting, with the nutritionist, and over e-mail and provided multiple ideas on how they could improve things.

The award-winning student newspaper, well-rounded student athletes, and many other clubs provide spaces for students to grow beyond the classroom by facing the challenges of non-academic self-deceloped group projects and events that prepare these men for life ahead in ways a class cannot. But watch out! The school is small enough that there is always a chance you may be late to class because you got caught talking to a professor or another student on the way because at Wabash there is danger of real, deep talk....

There are small class sizes, strong department communities, and extremely professional instructors. There are also many opportunities for research available. The coursework is extremely difficult compared to other universities, so much so, that when employers compare NMT candidates against ones from other schools, they often add a full GPA point to the NMT candidate's application. The campus is small and gorgeous with excellent landscaping and a beautiful field and golf course. As far as social life, it's difficult to make time outside of studies. When you do have free time, there's very few activities available in the town to spend it on. The school hosts many events throughout the year, but these are infrequent and attendance is often low.

The campus is truly unique, the professors are great, and the people are even better. 

If you are considering applying to Pitzer, please take note of the following...
- Academics are HARD. You will have a lot of work...But it is manageable.
- TONS of clubs and student ran organizations
- Supportive professors that care about their students (always open to meet or just talk if needed) 
- 5C advantage (BEST PART, let me explain) 
Pitzer is a member of the 5Cs, meaning you can take classes at any of the colleges (You can also off campus major if Pitzer doesn't offer a specific study/disciplinary you are interested in), Additionally, lots of students from all schools interact, are in clubs together, and actually support each other. 
- Food is world-class, and dining options are never slim (7 dining halls on campus).

Professors were always open to office hours while academics were rigorous and challenging (the fact that every student worked hard was a motivating factor as well). I felt that I developed strong friendships that will last a lifetime. Having Bible studies and weekly worship were also crucial in my walk of faith and developing a sense of community on campus.
One (rather small) critique that I have is housing. I believe it is essential that students have the option to live off-campus and/or have more options to live in their own rooms.
One other thing to note is that Wheaton is a great school for those who know their calling. The academics, connections, and community will encourage and help build the skills you need to get to the next step.

The campus itself is vibrant and dynamic with tons of student groups, activities, and career and networking events. One of the best things about it is the location since it's downtown Indianapolis, students are near internships, cultural activities, and career-building prospects. Professors are friendly and experienced, and learning is enhanced through utilizing facilities such as libraries and research centers.

However, there are a few things that could be better. Parking is occasionally a problem, and certain students complain about the tuition and fees are too high compared to the facilities provided. More scholarship opportunities and a renovation of campus facilities would be an excellent idea.

I also really appreciate how the buildings are separated yet still close to each other. One area I would suggest improving is the building design itself, perhaps by tailoring it to each major, though I know they are already working on this. As for education, I would definitely recommend that the school consider mandating sign language as part of the curriculum. I believe it's important to learn a language that fosters communication with the deaf community, especially since RIT is the largest technological college in the world for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.

It is a religious university and does a great job at including faith and Christianity into academics and campus life. Although the surrounding town is small and lacks activities for college students, there are plenty of nice coffee shops, parks, and quiet spaces around the town. It's also around 30 minutes from another town with a lot of things to do. The community is very friendly, kind, and inclusive, and the the student life team provides a lot of chances to get involved in various sub-communities at the school. It's easy to meet people as well if you attend the various campus events the host (some specifically for new students).

The night life is fun, and it can even be too fun if you're not careful. Most of the time when you're drinking with classmates, you're having conversations about theology, philosophy, telling stories, or singing folk songs around a campfire. Drinking is used as a social lubricant, but it's not what everyone does, so it's easy to avoid if you're not into that. Thankfully, night life doesn't include sexual promiscuity.

Although I haven’t started classes at Ball State University yet, my experience with the university so far has been very positive. The admissions team has been incredibly helpful and responsive, making the process smooth and welcoming for me as an international student.

What stands out most is the friendly communication and support I’ve received, especially during such a stressful and important time in my life. I feel that Ball State truly cares about its students, and that gives me confidence in my decision to join the Cardinal family.

While I’m still waiting to fully experience student life on campus, I look forward to exploring more opportunities in academics, student life, and personal development.

Currently, I cannot speak on the state of the food offered since we just signed on with a new cafeteria company. However, in the past, the food was adequate and offered a diverse range of options. The athletics program isn't great since it has only recently been established and doesn't have a strong foundation, so if you're looking to come to New College to play sports, it probably isn't worth it.

Do be aware that while it is on an island, UH is still kind of a city school-- Honolulu, while gorgeous, is very much so urban instead of the luscious greenery and unending beach that some students are expecting. There is also a culture that needs to be understood/accepted on the island. It's a double-edged sword: be prepared to be called out on your ignorance at some point for something, but also, closed-minded people tend not to do well/last on the island. So, while you may need to adjust your own thinking sometimes, you will also be surrounded and supported by people going through the same thing. If you love and respect the island, it will love and respect you right back. Truly.

Additionally, faculty and staff seemed to either support their students and be willing to fight alongside them tooth and nail in the face of adversity and injustice, or write them off completely.

Some professors tend to focus more on talking about their content then genuinely teaching students which makes it hard to follow along in a class. There are some professors, however, that are amazing and go out of their way to make sure that what they are teaching is being understood and is willing to set aside time for students to discuss questions with them as well. Housing at Salisbury University is hit or miss. A friend of mine, my current roommate, had to move rooms because her old dorm room had mold in it. My dorm room's AC unit has not been working since the beginning of the school year but other than that, the buildings themselves are nice and in the cluster style rooms housekeeping cleans the bathrooms every weekday.

The first year I was here, they painted the rock to look like the trans flag.

Whenever I walk down the hall in the library where all the advisors are, I see little pride flag stickers on the nametag outside their door, or on their door, to show that their office is a safe space. If it's not on the door, it's on the decor somewhere in their office. Not saying all of 'em have it, but it's really common here.

Also they recently added a bunch of new recycling bins. They used to only have one for plastic bottles- One next to every trash can- but this year, there's now a paper bin and an aluminum can bin next to all of them.

A few things I would like to see change is a wider science program--especially within physics. They currently do not offer a physics major, and minoring in physics is difficult due to their narrow range of physics courses. The few physics courses they do offer are amazing, though.
The other, maybe more minor annoyance, is that they literally never close no matter how terrible the weather is. They say it themselves that many courses only have 1-3 classes each week, so even missing one class can have a massive impact. Yet, they won't close even when we are deep in the negatives with possible -40 wind chills and all other schools are closed.

Academically, it is a solid school with several excellent professors. However, the school leans more toward a traditional, old-school approach to education.

Many professors follow conventional methods; for instance, only a few use slides or offer Zoom classes. If a student misses a class due to athletic commitments, they must rely on their classmates for notes or turn to the textbook, as recordings or supplemental materials are not typically provided. Additionally, grades are not consistently updated throughout the term—they are only made available during midterms and finals week.

What I liked the most is how student-centered UNCP is. They emphasize small class sizes, individualized support, and diversity. As someone coming from Ghana, I appreciated how welcoming the school is to international students. Their commitment to affordability and academic excellence stood out to me.

Scheduling meetings with a counselor or advisor has to be done a month out, so last minute questions or time sensitive issues must be resolved through personal ingenuity and resourcefulness. Professors are by and large knowledgeable, kind, and understanding. Graduating was not difficult to achieve, but it was undeniably done almost entirely alone.

Social life at Hunter is illusive and difficult to gain access to. The student body is largely made up of commuters, meaning that the friendships you might make through sheer proximity at any other school are hard to come by here. A great method for making friends at Hunter is by joining a club, of which there are many to choose from.

That’s what makes St. Francis so valuable. You’re learning from subject matter experts. Classes are genuinely challenging. St. Francis is NOT a party school. You’ll spend most of your time studying.

Unfortunately, I get frequent safety alerts about issues with crime in the neighborhood. Being situated in downtown Portland, where homelessness, drugs, gang activity, and thus crime are rampant, works against the safety of the campus. I have been alerted to activity involving people in the vicinity of campus with weapons - armed robberies of stores and muggings, etc - at least once a month since I started. Some of the professors are great, some are awful. This is probably the same everywhere. I have really appreciated the willingness of the professors to work with me, as a returning student who also works full-time. The tuition-free degree was the big draw for me, though the university did not offer it to me again this year, which is financially devastating.

If you weren't accepted to the main campus, there's still a chance to be accepted at MUNSON; it's a 2-year program that transfers you to the main campus. The best parts about this campus for me were the professors, curriculum, and the friends I met there. The campus is a lot smaller than the main campus, so it's easier to make friends and be close with the professors. My art improved a lot during my time there due to the intimate and constructive critiques and classes. The campus is also a lot cheaper compared to main campus.

You will benefit from the education at MUNSON, but there are some serious things to consider before attending. The campus location is very barren and sometime dangerous. There are little to no fun places in Utica to enjoy. The institution is the biggest con, both at MUNSON and at the main campus.

I created lifelong friendships and “grew up” here. I loved the small classes,  resources and opportunities offered to students. I got to work part time as a teaching assistant, do undergrad research, participate in clubs, and hung out with the professors during their office hours. 

I especially liked being able to hop on the train to head into the city on the weekends for the nightlife, clubbing and shopping on Friday and Saturdays. Pace offers the traditional campus college life with the bustling life of the big city minutes away by train. 

As for the science program, I wished they didn’t overlap physics and chemistry in the schedule that they do, which means you can’t double major in physics and chemistry without adding an extra year. So, essentially you have to pick one. I also wished the program wasn’t so small. There were not a lot of students to connect with. I hope this has improved....

Not only is their curriculum is easy to understand, but also straight forward and their advisory team makes to where you understand and help when needed. There is not much I would change because I haven't experienced much, but one thing that does need some change would have to be the professors.

Populi and Canvas made learning seamless, and affordability sealed the deal. Downsides? The CVU name feels niche, some course videos are dated, and electives are limited.

Academics - If you are in the Science faculty, get ready to dive right in to fairly rigorous/difficult coursework! If you are not prepared to work, you will likely fail. There are helpful resources (for all students) like office hours, resume help, and research help, (at the library) so do take advantage of them!
Meal plan - The student meal plan (required for first years) is not sufficient for a student living on campus 7 days a week. It is designed for a student who goes home on weekends/holidays, so do keep that in mind. Also, the food at The Cove is okay, but not accessible for students with basically any dietary restrictions. (ex: gluten free, vegan) Individual items add up very quickly for a student who is trying to budget. (ESPECIALLY avoid spending your first year meal plan money at the SUB.

The professors are incredible people, I had a couple that I wouldn't take classes with again, but overall great. I chose to pursue grad school and felt very supported as many professors stepped up to write LORs gaining me a spot at a top university. A con of the AAC is that they are apparently very thin financially, building/studio repairs will get made but new problems always arise, and the food situation's not cheap or sustainable to live on, you will need to buy groceries here.

Academically, professors are knowledgeable and approachable, but class experiences vary. Some are engaging, while others feel more like large lecture sessions. Advisors are helpful, but students must take initiative in planning their schedules.

Student life exists, but CSI is primarily a commuter school, so getting involved in clubs and events is key to making connections. While Staten Island has some spots to explore, many students head to Manhattan for entertainment.

However, if you want a school with numerous on and off campus involvement opportunities, than OCU is probably not the place for you. It is a relatively quiet campus, with what many would consider to be strict rules. I personally do not mind the rules, but as I said before, I enjoy the small Christian aspect of OCU. Though they may not always execute it perfectly, the administration does truly care about the students and their success. If you take the time to talk to them, the 'big names' at the school, such as the president and provost, will take time out of their busy schedules to pour into your life and truly get to know you.

I stayed silent at first, fearing backlash at a Christian university, but as the discussion remained one-sided, I felt the need to contribute.

But obviously if I'm halfway through my degree's program, I obviously liked the school enough to stay and not transfer! (Please admissions give me more aid!) The academics in the Cyber program are very in depth and you get a solid education and understanding of Networking just a quarter way through the program. And now that I'm in term 6 out of 12 now (Yes, you read that right the program is only 3 years long with classes towards the middle-end of July) I feel very confident about my ability to hopefully land a job after I graduate.

Overall Experience:
Felician University offers a well-structured academic environment with a strong emphasis on nursing and healthcare programs. The university provides small class sizes, which allows for more personalized attention from professors, and the faculty members are generally supportive and knowledgeable.

Housing is pretty normal but occasionally the water will run cold and the outlets might not work. Maintenance takes quite some time to fix issues.

For example, the main grocery stores are very far away and not within walking distance, making it exceptionally hard for international students to do grocery shopping. Additionally, the food offered at dining halls is not the best. International students are, thus, often forced to pay extra for delivery of groceries or pay people to drive them around.

- It's in NYC-- the capital of the world. I went to so many places and art museums for my classes!

Cons:

- TNS is very expensive -- avoid student loans whenever possible!

I would say that one of the weaker aspects of McDaniel College is the food options. There are two main sources of food on campus, the dining hall and the upstairs pub.

It has good academics and some great professors. Some professors aren't, and you will be warned by upperclassmen of any that are bad. The classes are very hard, and this is due to the shortened semesters to allow the co-op program. 11 week (3 month) semesters allow for 4 semesters per year, 2 school and 2 work. You are required to get at least 5 terms of co-op/internship credits, allowing you to graduate with up to 2.5 years of relevant work experience, and it's paid. The party scene is good for a school with 1600 students, and half on campus at a time. This is due to the work term/school term life causing an A-Section and a B-Section. The average class size allows for an abundance of opportunities to have 1-on-1 with professors and get to know them. Overall I think it's a good experience with great campus life and lots of opportunities. But due to it's difficulty and fast pace, it's not for everyone....
